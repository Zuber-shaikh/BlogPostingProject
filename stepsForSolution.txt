As per the given problem statement, it seems we'll need to handle post creation,
deletion, editing on user level. So, we would need to have a login page for the
user and based on the user, the home page will the user's posts. And he can
perform create, update, delete on the posts.

1st page("/"):
    It will be a login page, when user enters his userId, password and clicks
    on submit button, he will be redirected to the home-page for that user.

2nd page("userName/home"):
    Based on the user, the home page will display his posts.
    Each posts will have an update and delete button to update/delete the post.
        update --> "userName/postId/update"
        delete --> "userName/postId/delete"
    Also this page will have a createPost button to create a new post.
        create --> "userName/create"

3rd page("userName/postId/update"):
    This page will display the post which user wants to edit and here the user can
    edit his post. It will also have an update button, to save the post after editing

4th page("userName/postId/delete"):
    This page will display the post which user wants to delete. It will also have a
    delete button, when user clicks it, the post will be deleted.

5th page("userName/create"):
    This page will have textbox in which the user can enter his post and once done,
    he can click on the create button and the post will be create.

In 3rd, 4th, 5th page after the user performs the respective action, he will be
redirected to the home page.
